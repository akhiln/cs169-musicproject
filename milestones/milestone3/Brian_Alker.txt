I looked at the rideshare application, perhaps a bit inspired by my own recent attempts to secure a ride home for Thanksgiving through craigslist. What immediately caught my eye as I created an account was the address auto-completion: as you type your address in, the text field automatically generates suggestions for the address you're typing. I was intruiged, so I downloaded the source code and took a look at their application. I used the routes.rb file to navigate to the appropriate controller, which led me to the view that makes the text box. There was nothing special in the view; it was simply a normal text field inside of a form_for block. I looked through the layouts, and all the rest of the views, and found nothing relevant. The controllers were empty, the models boring. I finally found the workhorse, the actual javascript function that interacts with Google's geocoder to guess the address, but I couldn't find out how this Javascript block was tied to the text field. I found another location where the same technique was used; I couldn't find the hook for that one either. At this point, I can only speculate that some gem is swooping in, doing autocompletion, and then leaving without a trace. This is acutally one of the things that annoys me about Rails; since everything is done declaratively, and there are so many places to declare things, it's very difficult to trace back the flow of execution. To be certain, you would have to memorize every convention and point-cut that Rails has, which is a daunting task to say the least.
