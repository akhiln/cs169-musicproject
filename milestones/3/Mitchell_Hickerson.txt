I chose to look at the "whiteboard" website at 
http://white-board.heroku.com
which is aimed at hosting collaboration through the use of an online
drawable whiteboard.
      One feature that I enjoyed was viewing the available gallery
of whiteboards as a group of thumbnails.  It allowed me to pick out
which picture was mine relatively quikly; I could see this becoming
a problem if they don't add a search function, however.  They create
a thumbnail for the gallery inside the gallery's create controller.
